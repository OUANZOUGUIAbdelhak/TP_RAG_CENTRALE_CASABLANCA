LangChain: pipeline RAG
ChromaDB: vector store
Sentence-Transformers: embeddings HF
pypdf: loader PDF
transformers, torch, accelerate: LLM open-source
huggingface-hub
We are going to use these libraries to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with LangChain, ChromaDB, and Sentence-Transformers.
